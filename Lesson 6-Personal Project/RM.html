                    <td>: Kim Namjoon aka RM, fell in love with rap after hearing Epik High‘s “Fly” 
                        for the first time when he was in sixth grade. 
                        He began rapping on his own, 
                        and he started a career as an underground rapper under the name “Runch Randa” 
                        in 2007, when he was in middle school. With his reputation growing, 
                        RM was invited to audition for an underground hip-hop agency. 
                        This was where he met Untouchable‘s Sleepy, who was a judge at the audition. 
                        Sleepy was so impressed by RM’s rapping skills, 
                        he saved his phone number and passed it along to producer Bang Shi Hyuk.
