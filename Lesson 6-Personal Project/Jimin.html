                        <td>:The final member to join BTS, Park Jimin is originally from Busan, Korea. 
                            He attended the Busan High School of Arts, where he was a top student in the Department of Dance.
                             Jimin had a natural talent in dance. As a promising young contemporary dance student, 
                             one of his dance teachers urged Jimin to audition for Big Hit Entertainment. 
                             After being encouraged by his teacher, he went and auditioned. 
                             He passed the audition in Busan, and moved to Seoul to become a trainee. 
                             Although his training period was the shortest, Jimin became the final member of BTS because of his natural skills. 
                             During his trainee days, Jimin was often seen backdancing for GLAM’s “Glamorous” performance. 
                             He also had a brief cameo in GLAM’s music video for “Party (XXO).”</td>
