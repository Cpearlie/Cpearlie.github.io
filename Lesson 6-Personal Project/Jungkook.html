                    <td>How was Jungkook discovered?</td>
                    <td>: Jungkook auditioned for the 3rd season of Superstar K in his hometown of Busan, Korea. 
                        Although he was eliminated from the auditions, various agency recruiters saw something special in him.
                        Jungkook was scouted by 7 different entertainment agencies. 
                        Some of these agencies included JYP Entertainment, FNC Entertainment, and Starship Entertainment. 
                        Out of all of the agencies, Jungkook ended going with Big Hit Entertainment.
                        The reason he chose Big Hit (which was a smaller company at the time) over the other major companies was because 
                        he was so impressed with RM and his rapping skills. 
                        He wanted to be in the same company with RM, and train with him.
                        During his trainee days, Jungkook was often seen back-dancing 
                        for Big Hit Entertainment artists. He was seen during live 
                        performances of GLAM’s “Glamorous,” 
                        as well as Jo Kwon’s “I’m Da One.”
