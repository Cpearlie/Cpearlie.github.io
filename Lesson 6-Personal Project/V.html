                        that he grew up with hardly any money. 
                        He was raised by a family of farmers in Daegu, 
                        and his childhood dream was to pursue music.With that dream in mind, 
                        V picked up playing the saxophone in high school fro 3 years. 
                        One day, he followed a friend to a Big Hit Entertainment audition. 
                        He had only come to the audition to support his friend, but someone from the
                        rookie development team saw V and urged him to audition. 
                        So he called his dad, got permission, then auditioned on the spot. 
                        He was the only person to pass the audition in Daegu that day. 
                        Prior to his official debut, 
                        V was kept under wraps by Big Hit Entertainment </td>
