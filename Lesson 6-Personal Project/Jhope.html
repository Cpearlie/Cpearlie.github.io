                    <td>: Prior to his debut with BTS, 
                        Jung Hoseok aka J-Hope, was a dancer. 
                        He had always loved to dance, 
                        he joined a dance crew called “Neuron” in his hometown of Gwangju, Korea. 
                        Because of his love for dancing, J-Hope decided to audition for JYP Entertainment. 
                        Although he passed the first few rounds, he eventually got cut from the JYP auditions. 
                        J-Hope decided to audition for Big Hit Entertainment next. With his dance skills, 
                        strong understanding of rhythm, potential for rap, and many more. 
                        J-Hope was accepted into the company. He moved to Seoul, and became a full-time trainee. 
                        Despite years of training, however, J-Hope was almost left out of BTS’s 
                        lineup until RM convinced Big Hit (as well as J-Hope himself) that BTS 
                        needed J-Hope. So he returned to the group. </td>
